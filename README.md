# Project Name: Biker Navigation and Traffic Assist 

# Project Story: Jim is the avid biker and he bikes to work and other places so as to 
# maintain healthy lifestyle and also being eco-friendly. when I ride my bike, I am bit annoyed 
# by city traffic and rash pedestrian/rider/driver behaviour. I need to be assisted when it comes to
# navigating through city traffic. I need computer vision platform which can detect vehicles, objects and 
# pedestrians on road. Also, ability to detect the traffic signs, alert in case of imminent danger using pose estimation
# both from human and vehicles. We need series of models which does semantic segmentation with further classification into
# pedestrian,rider
