# Project Name: Biker Navigation and Traffic Assist 

# Project Story: 
Jim is the avid biker and he bikes to work and other places so as to 
maintain healthy lifestyle and also being eco-friendly. when I ride my bike, I am bit annoyed 
by city traffic and rash pedestrian/rider/driver behaviour. I need to be assisted when it comes to
navigating through city traffic. I need computer vision platform which can detect vehicles, objects and 
pedestrians on road. Also, ability to detect the traffic signs, alert in case of imminent danger using pose estimation
both from human and vehicles. We need series of models which does semantic segmentation with further classification into
pedestrian,rider.

# Location Services
Also, we have location services integrated in the bike which tracks the bike location and recommends suggested shops, restaurants, food joints based on interest and personalized discount offers. In addition, it connects with social media friends 
shares the location.

# Security
As security feature, in case of accident, theft or unforeseen incident, it reports about the incident with evidence to the relevant authorized personnel. 

# Bike Repair Shop
We have diagnostics services which captures the bike metrics 

As of now, this is in prototype form where we run the multi-task model in edge cloud or any Raspberry Pi Kit integrated with Intel NCS stick loaded with OpenVINO kit and camera module.Later, this would integrated into a SoC chip using either FPGA or ASIC mechanism and integrated in the cycle.
